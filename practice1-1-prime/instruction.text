Write a function that calculates the sum of all prime numbers up to 
and including a given number n. The function should:

Accept a positive integer n as input.
Calculate the sum of all prime numbers from 2 to n, inclusive.
Return the sum.
For example:

For n = 10, the sum of prime numbers up to 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
For n = 20, the sum of prime numbers up to 20 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 77.
